# Money-Transfer
I was inspired to do this addon (script) when I saw the money transfer from DerCoderJo but there was a slight problem with his addon. It was difficult to select an exact amount since it was done with a slieder, so I reworked the addon and made the slieder to a textfield.
To use the addon (script) you have to enter "!pay" in the chat

If you don't have any money, it will be shown in the chat like that

To get money you have to run the command /scoreboard players add @s money 1000 

If you have money and are playing alone, this will be shown in the chat

With the first selection “Choose a player” you select the player you want to transfer money to



With the second selection "How much money do you want to transfer?" Enter the amount you want to transfer. If you enter something that is not a number, this error message will appear in the chat



The third selection "Greet" is optional with the greeting you send an additional message to the selected player
